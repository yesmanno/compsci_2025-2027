# Lists Exercises

## Section 1: Lists

**Instructions:** For each question, write the code in Python to solve the problem.

1. **Declaration:** Declare a list of integers named `scores` that can hold exactly 5 elements. Initialise it with the values `85`, `92`, `78`, `95`, and `88`.
2. **Access:** Print the third element of the `scores` list.
3. **Modification:** Change the value of the first element in `scores` to `100`. Then, print the entire list to verify the change.
4. **Traversal:** Write a `for` loop to print every element in the `scores` list.
5. **Sum:** Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all elements in the `scores` list.
6. **Average:** Write a program that calculates and prints the average of all elements in the `scores` list.
7. **Find Highest:** Write a program to find and print the highest score in the `scores` list.
8. **Find Lowest:** Write a program to find and print the lowest score in the `scores` list.
9. **Search:** Ask the user for an integer. Check if that number exists in the `scores` list and print a message indicating whether it was found or not.
10. **Copy:** Create a new list called `new_scores` that is a copy of the `scores` list. Change an element in `new_scores` and print both lists to show they are independent.

## Section 2: 2D Lists

**Instructions:** For each question, write the code in Python to solve the problem.

1. **Declaration:** Declare a 2D list named `grades` with 3 rows and 4 columns. Initialize it with the following values:

```text
90 85 92 78
88 91 85 95
76 80 82 85
```

2. **Access:** Print the element in the second row and third column.
3. **Modification:** Change the value of the element in the third row and first column to `99`.
4. **Traversal:** Use a nested `for` loop to print all the elements of the `grades` 2D list.
5. **Sum of a Row:** Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of all elements in the first row.
6. **Average of a Column:** Write a program that calculates and prints the average of all elements in the second column.
7. **Find Highest:** Write a program to find and print the highest grade in the entire 2D list.
8. **Search:** Ask the user for an integer. Check if that number exists anywhere in the `grades` 2D list and print a message indicating whether it was found or not.
9. **Row Sums:** Write a program that calculates and prints the sum of each row.
10. **Column Averages:** Write a program that calculates and prints the average of each column.

## Section 3: Lists (Dynamic)

**Instructions:** For each question, write the code in Python to solve the problem.

1. **Declaration:** Declare a list of strings named `names`.
2. **Add Elements:** Add the following names to the `names` list: `"Alice"`, `"Bob"`, `"Charlie"`, and `"David"`.
3. **Print Size:** Print the number of elements in the `names` list.
4. **Access:** Print the second element of the `names` list.
5. **Insert:** Insert the name `"Eve"` at the beginning of the `names` list.
6. **Remove:** Remove the name `"Bob"` from the `names` list.
7. **Check:** Check if the name `"Charlie"` exists in the `names` list and print a message.
8. **Traversal:** Use a `for` loop to print every element in the `names` list.
9. **Clear:** Clear all the elements from the `names` list.
10. **Empty Check:** After clearing, check if the `names` list is empty and print a message.

## Section 4: Complex Programming Scenarios

**Instructions:** For each scenario, use a combination of lists to solve the problem in Python.

1. **Student Grades:** Write a program that stores the grades of 3 students for 4 subjects. Use a 2D list to store the grades. For each student, calculate their average grade and print it.
2. **Inventory Management:** You have a list of product names and a corresponding list of product prices. The lists are `["Laptop", "Mouse", "Keyboard"]` and `[1200.00, 25.50, 75.00]`. Ask the user for a product name and print its corresponding price. If the product is not found, print an error message.
3. **Word Frequency Counter:** Write a program that takes a sentence as a string. Split the sentence into individual words and use a list to store the words. Count the frequency of each unique word and print the results.
